# Automatic Container building and testing

The containers can for be used in combination with our transparent singularity or neurodesk tool, that wrap the executables inside a container to make them easily available for pipelines:
https://github.com/NeuroDesk/transparent-singularity/
https://github.com/NeuroDesk/neurodesk/

The containers are hosted on dockerhub (https://hub.docker.com/orgs/vnmd/repositories)

## currently available tools

docker search vnmd
```

# pull containers
