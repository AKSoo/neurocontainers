# Sub-containers for VNM

The containers can for be used in combination with our transparent singularity tool, that wraps the executables inside a container to make them easily available for pipelines:
https://github.com/NeuroDesk/transparent-singularity/

The containers are build on dockerhub

The build scripts need to be executed in bash (WSL for windows will work)
