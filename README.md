# Sub-containers for VNM

The containers can for be used in combination with our transparent singularity tool, that wraps the executables inside a container to make them easily available for pipelines:
https://github.com/NeuroDesk/transparent-singularity/

The containers are hosted on dockerhub and singularity files are saved to swift storage
https://hub.docker.com/orgs/vnmd/repositories


The build scripts need to be executed in bash (WSL for windows will work)
